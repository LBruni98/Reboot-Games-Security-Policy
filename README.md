### 1. Outline of Business

### 2. Risks
#### 2.1 Theft of Hardware
Hardware theft can happen within the company. Many cases of this fall to poor security of the workplace, which will allow for people to breach and steal any storage device or even a computer, mainly because of important data being stored in these machines or devices, mainly data such as employee information or log in information.

To prevent hardware theft, the facility must be fitted with good security systems to prevent future break ins, time-locks or alarm systems. Lock up devices and keep them hidden to lower the chance of them being found and keep systems held tight with cables and heavy duty locks to prevent the systems from going mobile. If all fails, a hidden layer of security must be in place; system tracking software to maintain the position of where the systems are in the hands of the robber.

#### 2.2 Loss of Electricity
A power outage in the company 

#### 2.3 Disclosure of Passwords
#### 2.4 Social Engineering
Social Engineering is a practice that hackers can use to get unsuspecting users to reveal all sorts of information or even details that can aid the attacker in carrying out a network attack. This risk is made up of numerous methods the attacker can use into gaining these details, such as phishing, email scams, etc. Viruses can also make their way into the user’s PC via this method, mainly as an infected attachment via email scam that looks normal enough. This risk can not only be detrimental to the user’s machine, but to all machines that are connected, meaning that there is a chance that any unauthorized access can extend to other machines or a virus can infect other machines.

A good method of prevention is for the user to be careful when browsing emails and not to click on random and unfamiliar links. Any form of messages or emails that request personal or sensitive information should be avoided and/or deleted, which can outright prevent any information being stolen and any unauthorized access. Should there be any concerns of a virus in the system from a user clicking on a malicious link, each system should in the workplace should have a full system scan immediately so the virus can be dealt with as soon as possible.

### 3. Threats in an organisation
#### 3.1 Malware
Malware is seen as a common threat in organizations. It takes the form of applications or software but uses that as a front to hide its code or actual software inside and common forms include viruses, worms or ultimately, Trojans. These function differently though; viruses spread without the user's knowledge or consent or with key loggers that can track the users key strokes to gain access to information.

Trojans are the more dangerous form of malware, acting as normal software in presentation and could come along with sites that look authentic. When the user downloads them, they expect a proper program but as soon as they open it, the payload is active and can instantly infect or damage a computer 

### 4. ISO Standards
The ISO (International Standardization Organization) are an independent organization dedicated to creating standards in every industry. These standards are mainly guidelines for products, services and systems to ensure safety, efficiency and quality, even encouraging innovation and aids in providing solutions.

ISO 31000:2009 is one of the guidelines that comes under ISO 31000, with how the businesss can manage risk and can be used by any business regardless of size or sector.
