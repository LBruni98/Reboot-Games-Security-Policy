### 1. Outline of Business

### 2. Risks
#### 2.1 Theft of Hardware
Hardware theft can happen within the company. Many cases of this fall to poor security of the workplace, which will allow for people to breach and steal any storage device or even a computer, mainly because of important data being stored in these machines or devices, mainly data such as employee information or log in information.

To prevent hardware theft, the facility must be fitted with good security systems to prevent future break ins, time-locks or alarm systems. Lock up devices and keep them hidden to lower the chance of them being found and keep systems held tight with cables and heavy duty locks to prevent the systems from going mobile. If all fails, a hidden layer of security must be in place; system tracking software to maintain the position of where the systems are in the hands of the robber.
