### 1. Outline of Business
#### 1.1 Overview

### 2. Risk Assessment
#### 2.1 Risks in an Organisation
##### 2.1.1 Theft of Hardware
Hardware theft can happen within the company. Many cases of this fall to poor security of the workplace, which will allow for people to breach and steal any storage device or even a computer, mainly because of important data being stored in these machines or devices, mainly data such as employee information or log in information.

##### 2.1.2 Data Loss/Theft
Data Loss is where data is commonly lost, stolen, deleted or corrupted. In different cases, data could be lost or deleted due to human negligence and could be down to factors, such as making it unreadable or accidental deletion, as well as overwriting. There is a chance that data can be corrupted because of software or failure of a physical storage device; this data however may be recovered. In a worst case scenario, data can be stolen in either way; having someone steal a physical format or gaining unauthorized access into a website or system and stealing information digitally.

##### 2.1.3 Social Engineering
Social Engineering is a practice that hackers can use to get unsuspecting users to reveal all sorts of information or even details that can aid the attacker in carrying out a network attack. This risk is made up of numerous methods the attacker can use into gaining these details, such as phishing, email scams, etc. Viruses can also make their way into the user’s PC via this method, mainly as an infected attachment via email scam that looks normal enough. This risk can not only be detrimental to the user’s machine, but to all machines that are connected, meaning that there is a chance that any unauthorized access can extend to other machines or a virus can infect other machines.

#### 2.2 Assessment Procedures
##### 2.2.1 Theft of Hardware
To prevent hardware theft, the facility must be fitted with good security systems to prevent future break ins, time-locks or alarm systems. Lock up devices and keep them hidden to lower the chance of them being found and keep systems held tight with cables and heavy duty locks to prevent the systems from going mobile. If all fails, a hidden layer of security must be in place; system tracking software to maintain the position of where the systems are in the hands of the robber.

##### 2.2.2 Data Loss/Theft
In order to prevent data from being lost or stolen, it is imperative that backups are made and updated to ensure that the user can get to the intact data if said data is corrupted or lost. Also of crucial importance is to ensure that security measures are made to protect the data from being stolen or hacked; data access controls handle what sort of people can view and edit the data, encryption can protect the data contents to appear unreadable to attackers and security layers such as passwords can ensure that no one can enter seamlessly. Locking up storage devices after work hours can prevent people from breaking and entering.

##### 2.2.3 Social Engineering
A good method of prevention is for the user to be careful when browsing emails and not to click on random and unfamiliar links. Any form of messages or emails that request personal or sensitive information should be avoided and/or deleted, which can outright prevent any information being stolen and any unauthorized access. Should there be any concerns of a virus in the system from a user clicking on a malicious link, each system should in the workplace should have a full system scan immediately so the virus can be dealt with as soon as possible.

### 3. Threats in an organisation
#### 3.1 Malware
Malware is seen as a common threat in organizations. It takes the form of applications or software but uses that as a front to hide its code or actual software inside and common forms include viruses, worms or ultimately, Trojans. These function differently though; viruses spread without the user's knowledge or consent or with key loggers that can track the users key strokes to gain access to information.

Trojans are the more dangerous form of malware, acting as normal software in presentation and could come along with sites that look authentic. When the user downloads them, they expect a proper program but as soon as they open it, the payload is active and can instantly infect or damage a computer 

#### 3.2 Viruses
#### 3.3 Spam

### 4. ISO Standards
The ISO (International Standardization Organization) are an independent organization dedicated to creating standards in every industry. These standards are mainly guidelines for products, services and systems to ensure safety, efficiency and quality, even encouraging innovation and aids in providing solutions.

#### 4.1 ISO 31000
The ISO 31000 is one of their standards dedicated towards risk management, made up of individual documents made to help an organization with managing risk and helps out in achieving objectives. ISO 31000:2009 is one of the guidelines that comes under ISO 31000, with how the business can manage risk and can be used by any business regardless of size or sector.

### 5. Security Procedures
Security procedures are used to enforce the hazards that can be prominent in the workplace. These procedures usually are step-by-step instructions given to users for specific actions, such as logging in or entering the building, mainly to ensure secuirty is in place, the workplace is effective and the employees are safe.

#### 5.1 Awareness and Prevention
* Any suspicious activity must be immediately reported to the reception desk, which will forward the information given to the security team.

* Incidents of crime, real or suspected, must be reported to the reception desk, which will forward the information given to the security team.

* All personal valuables must be locked away, placed out of sight or located on the user and never to be left unattended.

* All systems at the end of use must be logged out and/or shut down.

* Offices must be locked when leaving, with the windows closed and locked. Lights also should be turned off and blinds closed.

* Laptops and tablets should be locked out of sight when unused, especially overnight. Laptops should be secured to the desk with a security cable or a steel enclosure when left in open areas.

#### 5.2 Logging In
* It is imperative for employees to ensure an ID card, given by Reboot Games, remains on their person. The login username is located also on the ID card. The password is the user’s date of birth, unless changed by the user themselves.

* All logins must be made by the correct user with the correct ID.

#### 5.3 Entering the Establishment
* Employees are issued with Identification cards and all employees are eligible in order to gain access into the grounds and other rooms, which are all within a certain level to access. ID cards are also used for any registration and login detail. All users must ensure protection of these ID cards and must not loan to other employees for access or any other purpose. Any ID card misuse will be met with disciplinary action from the company.

* All employees must park in the applicable car park behind the building.

### 7. Improving Network Security
#### 7.1 DMZ
A Demilitarized Zone or DMZ, in computer network terms, is sub-network that can be physical or logical that separates an internal or private LAN, Local Area Network, from any public networks. The DMZ has the external resources and services situated inside which makes it accessible from the internet. However, the internal LAN is unreachable because of the internet being part of the DMZ, providing the LAN with an extra layer of security.

The reason being that the DMZ is added as a layer of security is that as it blocks off the internal LAN, hackers can’t access the internal servers and data by means of the internet. Any service that can reached by the hacker, such as email, DNS, FTP, etc. are put into the DMZ, so any attack can mean that the private LAN is safe. A common way to do this is by having two firewalls, one for the internet and the server, and the other for the sever and the private LAN, where access to said LAN would be forbidden.

#### 7.2 Static IP
An IP address, or Internet Protocol address, is a unique number that is assigned to devices on a network and works the same way as a normal street address; identifying the device on the internet. IP addresses are used also for network devices to communicate with one another. A static IP address is manually configured for a device, unlike a dynamic one that changes with each network.

Static IPs can ensure that high tier security measures to a stationary address, unlike dynamic IP addresses where the network is constantly changing and this can allow for professional level firewalls and other advanced security systems, being a huge step up from dynamic IPs that just offer a good starting point of security.

#### 7.3 NAT
NAT, or Network Address Translation, is where a network device is given a public address to computer within a private network and is designed to improve security within a network and to cut down on the number of IP addresses that an organization needs.

What NAT does is hide the IP addresses of servers and computers on trusted networks from computers on other external networks. Should an attacker gain access, it would be hard to stage an attack on the computers as the IP addresses would be hidden from view by NAT.

### 8. Data Protection Procedures
#### 8.1 Compliance with the Data Protection Act
Reboot Games must ensure that employees and the organization must comply with the General Data Protection Regulation, UK Data Protection Act, 2018 and other sorts of data protection legislation. Reboot games are considered data controllers and the legislation applies here to the processing of personal data. All employees have a right to be informed about how all personal information is handled.

The information that will be handled will include the job applications, employees of all nature, these being past, current or potential employees. This data will be collected in accordance under the legislation, GDPR, as well as the restrictions imposed on how we may use that information.

Misuse of personal data, via loss, disclosure or failing to comply with the legislation and the rights of the employees, will result in any legal, financial or reputational consequence or damage. Any breach of law will result in urgent disciplinary action; penalties will be issued as well as loss of recruitment and income.

#### 8.2 Procedures
* All physical data will be kept in a secure place to prevent any unauthorised viewing. This applies to all sorts of data that can be presented physically and stored electronically.

* Written or printed paper/files will be kept within a locked filing cabinet or drawer.

* Employees will be responsible for any data printouts so that there is no unauthorised viewing as well as destroying any printouts that are no longer required.

* With any data stored electronically, there must be strong protection, both physically and electronically to prevent any threats.

* Data must have accessed assigned to specific employees and a strong password that is frequently changed. This applies to all digitally stored data.

* In physical terms, data stored on removable peripherals will need to be locked away in a secure position when unused.

* Data will not be stored directly to any laptops or other mobile devices. It will only be stored on a designated server located in a secure space.

* Data backups will be carried out regularily.

### 9. Disaster Recovery Plan
The risks and threats within a business can at some points take hold and cause a catastrophic effect on the business, so it is important to plan to mitigate against loss and to ensure survival. The following key elements are important to the disaster recovery plan.

#### 9.1 Recovery Process
The recovery process defines what important assets need protecting in the event of disaster. These assets are what are needed for the business to run, so the efforts that go into the recovery must be prioritized into them. Other such applications or assets that are used but not important to the company can be tended afterwards. This component is important to be used within a recovery plan, because should the company not tend to these crucial assets, then that company will suffer with trying to replace and reobtain the assets or otherwise face shut down.

#### 9.2 Defining Responsibilities
Responsibilities to certain tasks should be made clear in the event of a disaster. These tasks in question are given to members of the organisation to work on so the issues are being addressed. By organising people to specific key roles, communication is improved and there is less stressed for those involved with the recovery process. This key component in the plan is crucial as for the systems and assets to be recovered successfully and orderly, roles will need to be assigned to ensure the recovery process goes smoothly and calmly. Should this not be in place, then the organization will end up in chaos trying to recover the important assets. 

#### 9.3 Regular Testing
Testing is done to ensure that the plan is still in full effect against shifting risks that can come up from time to time. As these risks are being familiarised, it is important for the plan to reflect on how to deal with these risks, so regularly testing the plan is essential for it to work properly and ensure the company the best chance of success in recovery.
